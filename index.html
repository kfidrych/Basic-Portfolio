        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Philadelphia, PA. I spent the majority of my time watching animal planet and playing/working outside looking for animals. I studied Wildlife Biology at McGill University in Montreal, QC. I have been working for the last few years as a Restaurant/Bar Manager and am now looking to make a career shift.</p>
        <p>I am interested in pursuing a career in Web Development because it has always been a personal interest of mine that I have worked on here and there. Ideally this BootCamp will allow me to gain the tools necessary to make the shift!</p>
